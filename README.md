# New Server Side Render Component
Introducing the `<ServerSideRenderX />` component as a direct replacement for the core `<ServerSideRender />` component.

## Usage

Add the `server-side-render-x.js` file to the relevant place in your plugin (e.g. `/src/block/components`) and include in your code exactly as you would for `<ServerSideRender />`.
